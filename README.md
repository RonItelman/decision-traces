# Decision Traces: Making Meaning Explicit in AI-Supported Decisions

This repository accompanies my draft paper:

**AI as a Forcing Function for Shared Meaning:  
Decision Traces and the Unacknowledged Decision Surface**

The core idea:

> In many AI-supported decision workflows, humans and systems act confidently
> without ever confirming that they share the same meaning. Decision traces are
> a lightweight way to surface, record, and reuse those interpretive
> commitments before optimization.

## What are Decision Traces?

Decision traces are intended to make the *interpretive layer* of decisions
observable and reusable:

- what was ambiguous
- what was clarified
- what assumptions were chosen
- what uncertainty remains
- how that meaning was reused downstream
- standardizing traces allow for mathematical operations

They are designed to complement — not replace — existing decision science and
data governance practices.

## Benefits
Because traces are structured, they can be treated as mathematical objects:
we can define operations such as diffs, merges, constraints, and equivalence,
instead of leaving meaning implicit.
